    <center><h3>The plot of the movie:</h3></center>

      <center><p>The year is 1965, and the residents of New Penzance, an island off the
      coast of New England, inhabit a community that seems untouched by some of
      the bad things going on in the rest of the world. Twelve-year-olds Sam
      (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) have fallen in love and decide to
      run away. But a violent storm is approaching the island, forcing a
      group of quirky adults (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray)
      to mobilize a search party and find the youths
      before calamity strikes.</p></center>
