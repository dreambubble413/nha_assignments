    <center><h4>By Lana Del Ray </h4></center><br>

    I've seen the world,<br>
    Done it all,<br>
    Had my cake now.<br>
    Diamonds, brilliant,<br>
    And Bel Air now.<br>
    Hot summer nights, mid July<br>
    When you and I were forever wild.<br>
    The crazy days, city lights,<br>
    The way you'd play with me like a child.
  </p>

  <p>
    Will you still love me,<br>
    when I'm no longer young and beautiful?<br>
    Will you still love me,<br>
    when I got nothing but my aching soul?<br>
    I know you will, I know you will,<br>
    I know that you will.<br>
    Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
  </p>

  <p>
    I've seen the world, lit it up<br>
    As my stage now.<br>
    Channeling angels in the new age now<br>
    Hot summer days, rock 'n' roll<br>
    The way you play for me at your show<br>
    And all the ways I got to know<br>
    Your pretty face and electric soul
  </p>

  <p>
    Will you still love me,<br>
    when I'm no longer young and beautiful?<br>
    Will you still love me<br>
    when I got nothing but my aching soul?<br>
    I know you will, I know you will,<br>
    I know that you will.<br>
    Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
  </p>

  <p>
    Dear Lord, when I get to heaven,<br>
    please let me bring my man.<br>
    When he comes tell me that you'll let him in,<br>
    Father, tell me if you can.<br>
    Oh that grace, oh that body,<br>
    Oh that face makes me wanna party.<br>
    He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds
  </p>

  <p>
    Will you still love me,<br>
    when I'm no longer young and beautiful?<br>
    Will you still love me,<br>
    when I got nothing but my aching soul?<br>
    I know you will, I know you will,<br>
    I know that you will.<br>
    Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?<br>
    Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?<br>
    Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?<br>
