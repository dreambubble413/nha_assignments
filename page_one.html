  <p>
    Ever since people have been studying the <span style="color:#e6e600">&#x2606stars&#x2606</span>, no one has been able to tell us how the <span style="color:#e6e600">&#x2606stars&#x2606</span> got up into the sky in the first place. The reason why no one knows is because no one has ever asked me! I am going to tell you a story that has been passed down through my family for many generations. Don't ask me why my family was chosen to tell this story, we were just lucky, I guess. It all begins long ago, when there was no such things as <span style="color:#e6e600">&#x2606stars&#x2606</span>.<br>

    <br>Yes, you heard me right. There were no such things as <span style="color:#e6e600">&#x2606stars&#x2606</span>. When night time came, the sky turned <b><span style="color:#262626">black.<span></b> There were no pretty, twinkling lights for everyone to look in the sky. Can you believe that? Well, neither could Andy.
