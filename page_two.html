        Andy was a boy who lived when there were no <span style="color:#e6e600">&#x2606stars&#x2606</span>. He was a bit of a night owl, and he liked to stay up late at night. His mother always scolded him when he would fall asleep in his oatmeal at breakfast. But just the same, Andy loved walking around at night.<br>

        <br>One night about midnight, Andy got out of his warm bed, and snuck out of the house. He had to be quiet, because if his mother caught him, he would surely get in trouble. But, he made it out of the house, and he began his midnight stroll. He liked to walk down to the lake and sit on the edge and listen to the frogs sing their loud songs, while the water quietly lapped up against the shore line. But this night, Andy felt a little restless. The frogs were singing the same song they always sing, and he was getting bored.<br>

        <br>"I wish there was something else to do!" whined Andy. "I do like to be here at night, but there is nothing to do. Maybe I should just go to bed!"<br>

        <br>Andy was just about to get up and go to bed, which would make his mother happy, when he heard something in the water. Curious, Andy peered into the water. At first, all he could see was his reflection staring back at him. But then, SPLASH!!! Something was staring back at Andy.<br>

        <br>"Who are you?" Andy whispered.<br>
        <br>"Well, if you must know, I am Pierre, and I live in this lake."<br>
        <br>With eyes as wide as saucers, Andy asked, "What are you?"<br>
        <br>"I am a fish. What did you think I was? Loch Ness?" The fish named Pierre started to laugh uncontrollably.<br>
        <br>"I didn't mean to offend you, Mr. Pierre, but I have never seen a fish talk before!" Andy tried to lean closer to the fish.<br>
        <br>"No offence taken. But I have a job for you...um...what did you say your name was?" questioned the fish.<br>
        <br>"Andy."<br>
