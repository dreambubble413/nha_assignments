          Holding the beautiful thing Pierre called a star, Andy had a wonderful idea.<br>
          "I will throw them into the sky! I can make beautiful pictures to look at when I come down to the lake! Now I will have something to do!!!"<br>

          <br>So, Andy began his work. It took him a few days to figure out how to get the stars out of that lake, but he did it. Every night, Andy was down at that lake pulling the stars from out of the water with a lasso he made from an old rope. Once he pulled a star from the water, he would throw it with all of his might, into the black, dark sky. At first, Andy was worried that people would see the stars when they woke up, and not let him do it anymore. His fears vanished when he saw that the sun blocked the light from the stars he placed in the sky, making them invisible. So, every night he would work, making beautiful pictures that he could look at so he would not be bored at night.<br>

When he finished, he made his entire town stay up late one night to see what he had accomplished. They could not believe that Andy had put all of those stars into the sky. The town ended up staying up all night trying to find the pictures Andy made.<br>

          <br>Andy was very proud of his work! And he was also very excited, because now everyone didn't go to bed when it got dark! He could go out and find so many more things to do!<br>

          <br>Well, that is the end of my story. But I do have to tell you, that if you go out late one night to sit by a lake, and a fish named Pierre gives you a job, take it! You just may change a little piece of the world!<br>
